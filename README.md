# Think Incognito
Any website can identify and track you, even if you are using Private Browsing or Incognito Mode in your web browser. <b>Many people think that they can hide their identity if they are using private browsing or incognito. </b>
This article is going to prove them all wrong.

### How?
I will be answering to all your questions shortly.

  * Open your browser's *Private browsing* (Or, *Incognito mode*)
  * Go visit this website: <a href="https://think-incognito.herokuapp.com/">Think Incognito</a>
  * Searche anything you want to search on google there.
  * Close that window.
  * Open *Private browsing* or *Incognito Mode* (OR, normal browsing would also do).
  * Again visit the same website: <a href="https://think-incognito.herokuapp.com/">Think Incognito</a><br />

  
SURPRIZED????
Yes, the website can remember what you searched for even though you had visited it via the Private browsing or Incognito Mode. Yes, nothing is private in this world anymore!.
